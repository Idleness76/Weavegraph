# Contributing to Weavegraph

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Weavegraph! This project welcomes contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## üéì Project Origins

Weavegraph began as a capstone project for a Rust online course, developed by contributors with backgrounds in Python and experience with LangGraph and LangChain. The goal was to bring similar graph-based workflow capabilities to the Rust ecosystem with modern concurrency, type safety, and performance benefits.

While the project started in an educational context, **it has grown beyond the classroom** and continues active development as a production-ready framework. We're committed to maintaining and expanding Weavegraph well beyond the course completion.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.91 or later
- Basic familiarity with async Rust and the `tokio` runtime
- Understanding of graph-based workflows is helpful but not required

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Idleness76/weavegraph.git
   cd weavegraph
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and run tests**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo test --all -- --nocapture
   ```

3. **Run examples to understand the framework**:
   ```bash
   # Start with basic patterns
   cargo run --example basic_nodes

   # Explore advanced features
   cargo run --example advanced_patterns

   # See error handling in action
   cargo run --example errors_pretty
   ```

4. **Set up Ollama for LLM demos** (optional):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d ollama
   cargo run --example demo3
   ```

   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   cargo test --all
   cargo clippy
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

4. **Update documentation** as needed

5. **Submit the pull request**:
   - Provide a clear description of changes

   - Ensure CI passes

6. **Respond to feedback** and iterate as needed

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

When contributing, keep these architectural principles in mind:

### Core Principles

- **Composability**: Components should work well together
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for correctness
- **Performance**: Efficient concurrent execution without sacrificing safety
- **Observability**: Rich tracing and event streaming throughout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive, actionable error reporting

### Module Organization

- **`message`**: Keep message types simple and role-focused
- **`state`**: Maintain versioning and snapshot isolation
- **`node`**: Async-first design with clear error propagation
- **`graph`**: Declarative graph definition with conditional routing
- **`schedulers`**: Concurrent execution with dependency resolution
- **`runtimes`**: High-level orchestration and persistence
- **`channels`**: Efficient state storage and versioning
- **`reducers`**: Deterministic merge strategies
- **`event_bus`**: Non-blocking event streaming

### Design Patterns

- **Builder Pattern**: For complex object construction
- **Convenience Constructors**: Reduce boilerplate for common cases
- **Rich Error Types**: Provide context and suggestions
- **Instrument Everything**: Add tracing spans for observability

## üß™ Testing Philosophy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Property Tests**: Use `proptest` for edge case discovery
- **Example Tests**: Ensure all examples compile and run
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths

## üìã Project Roadmap
